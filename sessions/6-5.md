# Session 6-5: PHP types, variables, contants...

The instructor will point out a few key things in the [PHP Tutorial Series, Unit 2](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/tutorial/php-2.md)

And give you a few moments to try to complete [PHP ICE 1](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/tutorial/php-ex-1.md) as a team.

Anything you do during these Exercises should be stored, for now, in your Group Locker on myCourses.

## After this Session:

You should be ready to complete: 
  - PHP Study Quizzes for Unit 1 and 2.
  - Configuring php.ini Homework (and the Web Server Caching adjustment at the bottom of Unit 2)
