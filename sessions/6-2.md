# Session 6-2: Assessing Design

You will begin to work on an In-Class Exercise (which will continue into a homework with a short turn-around)

After the presentation from the last session, you're now ready to put your new knowledge and vocabulary to work.  

  - Grab the Word Document named **"HW-Design"** from the Session 6-2 Content area on myCourses
  - fill it out the first part, participate in the Discussions area, fill out the rest, and then submit it to the myCourses Assignment 
    - you will likely need to complete most of it after class.  
    **Important.  There are three parts.  Please don't miss a part.**
