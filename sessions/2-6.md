# Session 2-6: Adding Links

We'll add links (and embed images) with an emphasis on creating relative paths.  

## Before this Session
- Read *Learning Web Design*, Chapter 6.
- Complete the "LWD Chapter 6 Study Quiz" until you get the score you want.

## During this Session
- We will quickly review Chapter 6 material.
- You will further enhance the page we've been working on together by adding links.
    - Exercise: [Links](../exercises/links.md)

## After this Session
- We suggest that you post a version of your "[235 Home Page](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/hw/homepage.md)" with semantically marked up content and appropriate links.  Additional Images & better formatting coming soon.  We won't evaluate it until later on.

    - You should be able to do up through part V. of this exercise from the past now.  But it is not required.
