# Session 3-1: Adding Bitmap Images

In this session we'll review image formats, and cover how to add them and appropriately size them on your pages.

## Before this Session
- Read *Learning Web Design*, Chapter 7 (Pages 131-145) and Chapter 23 (Pages 641-660 and 665-667)
    - For those with E-book versions, that's from the beginning of Chapter 7, stopping just before "Responsive Image Markup"; and all of Chapter 23, omitting the "Image Asset Strategy" section in the middle.
- Complete the "LWD Chapter 7 (and 23) Study Quiz" until you get the score you want. 

## During this Session
- We'll begin with 5-10 minutes to work on the previous In-Class Exercise:  Here's a handy link:
    - Exercise: [Links](../exercises/links.md)
- We will review the Chapter 7 materials... With some references to the Chapter 23 stuff here and there.
- You will continue to work on the In-Class Exercise, moving on to the next step of adding various images to your page.
    - Exercise: [Adding Images](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/exercises/images.md)

## After this Session
- Your "[Basic Game Page](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/hw/basicpage.md)" Homework is due by next class, you're welcome to use these extra image skills in your project, but there are only minimal expectations for images for this Homework.  We have much higher image expectations for your next Homework.
- You should be adding an appropriately sized image of yourself to your "[235 Home Page](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/hw/homepage.md)".

## Other Relevant Resources
- [GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)](https://www.gimp.org/) - an open source alternative to Adobe Photoshop if you're looking for one.
