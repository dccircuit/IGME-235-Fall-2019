# Session 2-5: Marking Up Text

In this session, we'll cover multiple ways to format your text with a focus on semantic tags, meaningful order, and special characters.

## Before this Session
- Read *Learning Web Design*, Chapter 5.
- Complete the "LWD Chapter 5 Study Quiz" until you get the score you want.

## During this Session
- You will further enhance the page we've been working on together.
    - Exercise: [Structural and Semantic HTML](../exercises/semantic.md)

## After this Session
- After this, we are going to shift gears in your Homework and begin the creation of your own "[235 Home Page](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/hw/homepage.md)".  You should begin to consider what the information layout and organization will be for your 235 Home Page.
- Meanwhile, finish up your "Basic Game Page" as it will be due soon.  You do not need to have extensive HTML at all.  Just meet the other requirements for valid HTML code used to structurally mark up the page.
