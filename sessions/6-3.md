# Session 6-3: Intro to PHP
***(Note, students on MWF schedule may do Session [6-4](6-4.md) First)***

Here it comes!  We will begin to cover PHP.

There will be a presentation, with some hands on steps.

You'll be able to get started on the "[PHP Tutorial Series](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/tutorial/php-0.md)"

You may also leave this session with a new partner for tomorrow's Critique & PHP Exercises...
