# Session 2-4: Validating Documents

The single most important way to future-proof our pages is to follow HTML standards as carefully as possible.  Validation will help us accomplish this.

## Before this Session
- Have a start on your own basic page as you'll be adding a few more things to it afterward.

## During this Session
- You will add an image as well as a provided Style Sheet to your page.

## After this Session
- Add a custom image of your choosing and a simple style sheet to your own basic page & post it appropriately on banjo.
