# Session 2-4: Validating Documents

The single most important way to future-proof our pages is to follow HTML standards as carefully as possible.  Validation will help us accomplish this.

## Before this Session
- There is no specific reading assignment due, but we will be continuing to work with material from Learning Web Design, Chapter 4.

## During this Session
- We will validate our previous work and if time is available, another simple page.
    - Exercise: [Validation](../exercises/validation.md)

## After this Session
- You should run the validator on your own basic page and correct any validation errors.
