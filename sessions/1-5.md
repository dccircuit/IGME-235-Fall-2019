# Session 1-5: How the Web Works

We'll review the second chapter of *Learning Web Design* and use browser dev tools to get a real under-the-hood look at what is going on between server and client.

## Before this Session
- Read *Learning Web Design*, Chapter 2.
- Complete the "LWD Chapter 2 Study Quiz" until you get the score you want.

## During this Session
- You'll participate in an interactive review of the reading materials.  (Summary PowerPoints for review will be available afterward in myCourses).
- Follow along with the instructor as we explore the headers sent by browsers and servers.

## After this Session
- Nothing in particular.  Keep on breathing... Continue to use the developer tools to look at how your favorite web pages are put together.
