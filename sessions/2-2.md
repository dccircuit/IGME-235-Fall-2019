# Session 2-2: HTML for Structure

If you haven't really already, today you'll build a real web page, but first we have to make sure we have the foundations right.  We need to be building our pages using the right kind of markup.  

## Before this Session
- Read *Learning Web Design*, Chapter 4.
- Complete the "LWD Chapter 4 Study Quiz" until you get the score you want.

## During this Session
- You'll participate in an interactive review of the reading materials.  (Summary PowerPoints for review will be available afterward in myCourses).
- You will take some content that we will provide and mark it up as requested.
    - Exercise: [Initial Markup](../exercises/initial-markup.md)

## After this Session
- You will create a basic page of your own in a similar style and post it to banjo.
- It won't be due right away, but you can get started on building your own "basic page" using however much you've learned and practiced in class.
    - Homework: [Basic Game Page](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/hw/basicpage.md)
