# Session 4-1: Floating and Positioning

We'll discuss and practice these older (but still practical) layout methods for your page content.

## Before this Session
- Read Chapter 15 in *Learning Web Design* and take the Study Quiz.

## During this Session
- You may or may not get a little more time to finish up your Exercise: [The Box Model](../exercises/boxmodel.md) from the end of Session 3-6.  Either way it won't be very long.
- It's time to say goodbye to Dig Dug, but first we'll do one last thing: Exercise: [The end of Dig Dug](../exercises/end-of-digdug.md).
    - Note that this part ends with instructions to upload your work to a Group Assignment submission... So don't skip it.
- We will do an interactive review of Chapter 15 via PowerPoint
- Finally, we'll start on: Exercise: [Floats & Positioning](../exercises/floatposition.md).

## After this Session
- You'll know everything you need to know to hit every requirement on your [235 Home Page](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/hw/homepage.md) Homework.  That homework is due before your next regular class time.
