# Session 3-3: Intro to CSS

We'll introduce Cascading Style Sheets, how they work, and how to attach them to your HTML in other ways.

## Before this Session
- Read *Learning Web Design*, Chapter 11
- Complete the "LWD Chapter 11 Study Quiz" until you get the score you want. 

## During this Session
- We will have an interactive review of the material from Chapter 11
- We will add some additional CSS to our Dig Dug page.
    - Exercise: [Starting Styles](../exercises/styles.md).

## After this Session
- You could certainly start adding some custom CSS to your "235 Home Page" Homework now, but we wouldn't blame you if you wanted to get some more CSS rules under your belt.  Thankfully, that's what's coming up next.

## Other Relevant Resources
- Legacy Exercise for Practice: [Basic HTML, CSS, and Validation](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/notes/recipe.md)
    - You should theoretically be able to complete the rest of this exercise from the past now.  Again, it is not required nor is it worth extra credit.  But it might be interesting as an exercise for yourself & it will give you an early glimpse at a couple of other things that we haven't yet covered this semester.
