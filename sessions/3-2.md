# Session 3-2: Adding Vector Images

We'll briefly address adding SVG images and talk about why we're skipping Tables, Forms, and Embedded Media (for now).

## Before this Session
- No special reading before this class, unless you get really super interested in SVG images and want to go ahead and read Chapter 25 to learn more.

## During this Session
- The previous session will probably overlap into this one a bit.  So you may get some extra time to finish your Exercise: [Adding Images](../exercises/images.md).
- You will then step directly into the next exercise involving an SVG image and a favicon.
    - Exercise: [Adding More Images](../exercises/more-images.md)

## After this Session
- You should be working on your "[235 Home Page](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/hw/homepage.md)" Homework.

## Other Relevant Resources
- None, currently.
