# Session 12-5 to 12-6: ES6 Classes and PixiJS

We'll review the [2nd part of the PixiJS Tutorial Series](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/tutorial/pixi-js-2.md) and work together on the last portion of it.

## During this Session:
- We'll work on the last part of the PixiJS Tutorial Series (link above).
- With any remaining time:
  - Get feedback on your [Portfolio](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/portfolio.md) progress.
  - Look for a potential [Project 3](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/project-3.md) partner. 
  - Ask questions about [Project 2](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/project-2.md).
  - Get started on [Circle Blast homework](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/tutorial/HW-circle-blast-1.md).

## After this Session:
- If you haven't already had Project 2 Prototype/Critique day, get your Project 2 ready for it.
- Get started on your Circle Blast homework.
- Potentially, update your Project 1 so that it represents an accurate picture of what you (and your partner if you have one) intend to create for Project 3.  Note: If you're in a team, only one of you need to post this.
