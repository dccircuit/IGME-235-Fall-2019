# Session 1-3: Project Preview

During this part of our class time, you'll get an overview/and see examples of the projects that you'll be required to complete this semester.

## Before this Session
- Start to consider what kind of simple game you might want to create this semester.  Having several ideas in mind will serve you well especially if you discover that your favorite idea is just too far beyond what you can achieve in the time you have available.

## During this Session
- You'll hear a summary of what each of our 3 major projects as well your Digital Portfolio will be about.
- You'll get a chance to browse around some past projects and try them out.  Please share your best discoveries with your classmates.
    - ICE: [Browse Past Projects](../exercises/projects.md)

## After this Session
- Based on what you've seen and heard, begin to jot down your initial ideas for a game that you'd like to create into a document of some kind.  If you're up to the challenge, make your notes directly into a markdown file in your GitHub repository, perhaps called ideas.md
