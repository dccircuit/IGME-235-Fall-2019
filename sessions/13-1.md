# Session 13-1 and 13-2: Portfolio Reviews, Begin Circle Blast, Project Work/Questions

We'll discuss our updated course schedule & have a quick orientation to the Circle Blast Homework

## During the rest of this session you may:
- Get feedback on your [Portfolio](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/portfolio.md) progress.
- Get started on [Circle Blast homework](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/tutorial/HW-circle-blast-1.md).
- Ask questions about [Project 2](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/project-2.md).
- Look for a potential [Project 3](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/project-3.md) partner. 

## After this Session:
- Finish your Circle Blast homework.
- Finish your Project 2.
- Update your Project 1 so that it represents an accurate picture of what you (and your partner if you have one) intend to create for Project 3.  Note: If you're in a team, only one of you need to post this.
