# Session 6-4: Project 1 Critiques

We will provide feedback for our fellow classmates on their Project 1 Prototypes.

You'll sit in 4 person groups and take turns allowing people to look at your site, and receiving feedback.

During the process take notes about what you said and what was said to you and record it in the Critique Document.  You'll be submitting this document to a myCourses Assignment dropbox by midnight tonight... so you can take quick notes and expand on them later.
