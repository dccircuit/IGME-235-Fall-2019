# Frameworks and Libraries - Legacy Lecture Notes

## I. Topics
- CSS Frameworks
- JavaScript Libraries and Plugins
- HTML templates
- Code minification
- Single-page sites

We've talked about responsive design a fair amount, and been focused on hand-building our own pages. But in the real world, more and more developers are coming to rely on various resources of existing code that do a lot of the heavy lifting for them, and streamline the design and development process.

## II. Frameworks
A [CSS framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework) is a set of CSS that can be applied as a starting point for designing a responsive page or site. The big one right now is Bootstrap, which was originally developed as Twitter's underlying responsive CSS. There are a lot of them out there, though, including:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

One thing you'll notice in all these frameworks is that they provide both readable and [minified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)) code. This serves the purpose of decreasing our file sizes (and thus our download times), as well as making production code harder to decipher and copy.

## III. Libraries
There are also a ton of JS libraries in common use nowadays, giving us external JS files with access to new functions and functionality. We've already seen jQuery for processing AJAX and handling some other issues. Some of these libraries help streamline our processes, like jQuery, some help us build JS-based responsive sites, like Angular and React, some even add additional capabilities, like Node.js which lets us do server-side JS programming.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

You'll note once again that libraries like jQuery provide minified code, which can have a significant impact on file sizes.

## IV. Plugins
In addition to libraries, there are tons of plugins and other code snippets available on the Web to add functionality quickly. jQuery's site lists a ton of these. Another great example, useful for portfolios, is [Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/), a jQuery "lightbox" plugin for adding interactive galleries to your pages.

## V. Templates
While we're at it, let's revisit HTML templates (also known as HTML themes). There are a lot of options to choose from, most of which use both a CSS framework and a JS library in addition to their own custom HTML and CSS. Templates are a quick and easy way to take pre-fab pages, populate them with your own content, and have a responsive site up and running in potentially a matter of minutes. Of course, on your Projects you need to build your own pages, not use templates, but they are a great resource for future work! There are a lot of these online, but here are some random examples:
- [TemplateMo](http://www.templatemo.com/)
- [tooplate](http://www.tooplate.com/)
- [Templated](https://templated.co/)
- [Theme Forest](https://themeforest.net/category/site-templates)

Take a look at what they provide, and what frameworks/libraries they use.

## VI. Single-page Sites
Single-page sites are becoming more and more popular, especially in the age of responsive design. These include sites like the "endless scrollers" we see in social media like Tumblr and Facebook, the sectioned "whole site on one scrolling page" like many portfolios, and web-app sites where all the content is changed on one page via JavaScript.

[What are the advantages and disadvantages of single-page sites?](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/single-page-vs-multi-page-ui-design-pros-cons/)

Here are some cool examples:
- https://www.epicgames.com/paragon/
- http://www.ginventory.co/  
- http://tremorworks.com
- https://www.awwwards.com/websites/single-page/

Implementation:
- Some sites are simply a single page, nothing more.
- Some allow some in-page navigation, linking to IDs on the page
```html
<a href="#section1">Section 1</a>
```
- Some use JS to manipulate the DOM, hiding or showing different elements when navigation is clicked, or rewriting innerHTML
