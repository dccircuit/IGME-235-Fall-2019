# Session 2-3: Adding Image / Style Sheets

Now that we've added structure to our pages, we'll begin to enhance their look through the addition of images and stylesheets

## Before this Session
- Have a start on your own basic page as you'll be adding a few more things to it afterward.

## During this Session
- You will review a little more from Learning Web Design, Chapter 4.
- You will add an image as well as a provided Style Sheet to your page.
    - [Exercise: Add Image & Styles](../exercises/image-styles.md)

## After this Session
- Continue working on your "basic page" homework by adding a custom image of your choosing and a simple style sheet to your own basic page & post it appropriately on banjo.  You may want to hold off on the style sheet part until you've learned more about stylesheets.

## Other Relevant Resources
- [Marx](https://mblode.github.io/marx/) - Here's a possible stylesheet that you could add to your site that will improve the styling and general look of things simply by downloading it, adding it to your site structure, and linking to it as an external style sheet.
- [Bootstrap "Reboot"](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/reboot/) - A similar concept.  Not the full Bootstrap framework, but rather a CSS file to give (in their words) "an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon".
