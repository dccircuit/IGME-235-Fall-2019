# Session 1-1: Course Intro 1

During this part of our class time, you'll hear about your professor and teaching assistant, what we'll cover in this course, and how this class will work.

## Before this Session

  - Read the [syllabus](../syllabus.md) (or don't)... We'll go over it, but you'll want to know it.
  - Log in to our myCourses shell and make sure you can find the class, etc.
  - You should have purchased the class textbook: *Learning Web Design, 5th Edition* by Jennifer Niederst Robbins.

## During this Session
  - Find the class GitHub repository & session plans.  (spoiler alert, you just did)
  - Look over our myCourses and get the lay of the land.
  - Sign up for our class Discord - An invite link can be found in myCourses.
    -  Make sure that your Nickname matches your myCourses name.

## After this Session
  - Be sure you're signed up for Discord.  Post a hello message in the class channel.
  - On your own, complete [this GitHub tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and create your own "IGME 235" repository (instead of "hello-world").  You will be expected to use it a time or two this semester.
      - While you're at it, might as well get the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for free (it will allow you to create and access private repos).
  - If you don't already have it, obtain the Textbook.  You can buy it from the book store, or get it as a Kindle book on Amazon.com.  There are options to rent as well.
