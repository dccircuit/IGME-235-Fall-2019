# Session 3-4: Formatting Text & Backgrounds

We'll change some more text properties and styles and scratch the surface of what you can do with colors and background.

## Before this Session
- There's a lot of reading for this session, but do it with each Study Quiz open, each question has a reference to the section of the book that it's taken from. \[Look for the square braces\].  You should be able to do them quite quickly.
    - Learning Web Design, Chapter 12 has a lot of information about formatting text.  You can use it more like a reference than a chapter that you have to read in detail.
    - Learning Web Design, Chapter 13 is the same way, we won't cover all of it, but some of it you'll want to come back to later when you need it for your designs.

## During this Session
- We'll review the material from Chapter 12 & 13 that you'll need for the exercise and then...
- You'll visit your Dig Dug page one more time to apply some style.
    - Exercise: Formatting Text (in development)

## After this Session
- You should now be ready to apply some better text formatting to your "235 Home Page".
