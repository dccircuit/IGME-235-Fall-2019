# Session 11-5 to 11-6: GIF Finder, In-Class Portion

We'll complete our GIF Finder exercise and talk about possible improvements.

## During this Session:
- We'll work on the [In-Class Portion](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-235-Shared/blob/master/tutorial/HW-gif-finder.md#section10) of the GIF Finder exercise.

## After this Session:
- [Project 2 Details](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/project-2.md) - [PDF of Rubric]
- With your partner, if you've chosen one, figure out your chosen API and submit your proposal to the Project 2 - Proposal assignment. 
  - Important: If you're picking your own custom API, you must provide a link to a working proof-of-concept by Friday's deadline.
- Begin looking ahead to the materials about PixiJS and ES6 Classes.
