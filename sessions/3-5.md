# Session 3-5: CSS Color

We'll take a look at what you can do with colors.

## Before this Session
- There's a lot of reading for the next three sessions, but do it with each Study Quiz open, each question has a reference to the section of the book that it's taken from. \[Look for the square braces\].  You should be able to do them quite quickly.
    - Learning Web Design, Chapter 13 is the same way but with colors and backgrounds, we won't cover all of it, but some of it you'll want to come back to later when you need it for your designs.
