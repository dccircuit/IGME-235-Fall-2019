# Session 12-4: Project 3 Plans 

We'll discuss our Project 3 plans 

## During this Session:
- We'll go over the [Project 3](https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2019/blob/master/projects/project-3.md) plan.

## After this Session:

- Start considering what you want to do about Project 3.  Working with a partner is highly encouraged.  Have a look through people's Project 1 ideas.  If you'd like a partner for a particular idea or if you're open to joining someone someone else's team but you don't know who's interested, consider posting to the Discord channel for our class section.
