# Session 4-3: More Flexbox & Transition to Grid

We'll try a few more things with Flexbox & begin to approach CSS Grid.

## Before this Session
- It would be great to look at more of Chapter 16 before this session, but you may or may not have had time to do that.

## During this Session
- Finish the Exercise: [Flexbox](../exercises/flexbox.md).
- If you really get done, try the https://flexboxfroggy.com css game.  And move on ahead to the rest of Chapter 16 & https://cssgridgarden.com
- Study Quizzes for Chapter 16b and Chapter 17 are in development, currently.

## After this Session
- Go to https://cssgridgarden.com and see if you can complete all 28 levels.
