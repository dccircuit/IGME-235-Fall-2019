# Project 1 - Game Proposal Site

## I. Overview

For project 3, you will be making a Web game or "experience." To get you started thinking about this early, for Project 1 you'll be building a site to promote and document a Web game project. For the purposes of project 1, don't worry too much about the scope of the game, or the fact that your specs will probably change. Just think about what you might want to make. (But when looking ahead to Project 3, when you actually have to build something, we suggest you keep an eye on the Web for what sorts of apps and games other people are making that are small enough in scope for you to build in the span of a couple weeks.)

## II. Requirements

**Location:** The page will be located in the project1 directory in your 235 directory on Banjo. This means that the location of page on the web will be `http://people.rit.edu/abc1234/235/project1/` (where 'abc1234' is your RIT id), as shown below:

![Project 1 File Structure](_images/Project1Structure2019-235.png "Project 1 File Structure")  
Your main page for the proposal site will be the index page for this directory. You must have css and media directories to store the associated files. **Remember:** Our server is case sensitive, so your files **must** use the case indicated in this assignment. If your files are not named and located as instructed, we can't find them, and you will get a 0.

### II-A. Content and Structure

Content is the foundation of the Web; all pages exist to present some content, not the other way round. For this reason, your content needs to be written **first**. Your primary content is a _game design treatment_ containing most or all of the information found on this template: [http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/2017-fall/590-ios-game/html/project-1-proposal.html](http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/2017-fall/590-ios-game/html/project-1-proposal.html)


### II-B. Required Pages

The following pages (each in separate HTML files):
- **index.html**: your "landing" page (the default file for your project1 directory):
    - This page must have a brief overview of your project, contain at least one image, and most importantly grab the user's attention.
- **proposal.html**: what you plan to do, in more detail than the overview:
    - This page will be a game design document, specifically a game treatment that describes the development side of your game. This page is not a marketing document.
    - You should be hitting most or all of the things on this template (providing the content that would fill in for each roman numeral -- ignore the "Instructions" and "discussions" sections below the red lines): [http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/2017-fall/590-ios-game/html/project-1-proposal.html](http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/2017-fall/590-ios-game/html/project-1-proposal.html) <span style="font-size: 0.95rem; letter-spacing: 0.01rem;">- you can also read more about game treatments in the document uploaded to the content area of myCourses (Session 5-1).
    - This page will be marked up heavily with structural and semantic tags, some of which are listed below.
    - This page will contain at least two images.
- **documentation.html**: A documentation page, which will document your overall process, resources used, and notes about this current assignment. Cite the sources of all information, tutorials, images and other media used. Also indicate how you met the project requirements, and any additional specifics you want me to see.
- **project.html**: The game or app itself (the content will just be a placeholder for now, but the page needs to have the same look and navigation as the other pages)

### II-C. HTML/CSS Markup

- Semantic structural tags like `<header>, <section>, <article>, <nav>`, and `<footer>` should be used appropriately.
- Try to use a consistent structure on all of your 4 pages by repeating many of your design elements - for example: the `<header>, <footer>` and `<nav>` elements should be in the same places on each page and have the same colors, fonts and spacing.
- Be sure to have descriptive `<title>` elements for each page.
- CSS selectors and rules will be used for formatting and positioning:
- Most of the style rules will be located in an external style sheet.
- There will be at least 5 style declarations (rules) in your external style sheet.
    - At least one of these style declarations will utilize a _class selector_.
    - At least one of these style declarations will utilize an _id selector_.
    - Utilize custom link styles on all your pages by utilizing the `a:link, a:visited, a:focus, a:hover,` and `a:active` selectors. (These 5 pseudo-class selectors do not count towards the 5 style rule requirement above)
- Avoid using *inline* styles.

### II-D. Design

- College-level work
- Professionally styled so that so that the results are pleasing and in no way resemble any templates or in-class exercises. The page design will be well thought out with appropriate organization, spacing, colors and fonts, and all pages should be consistent in look, feel and navigation.
- Design principles (e.g. CRAP) applied appropriately.
- Navigation should be consistent across all pages, with a single, unified nav scheme, with all global nav in the same place on every page.
    - Good navigation should always answer the questions "Where am I?" and "Where can I go?" This means your nav should **always** be the same on every page; don't make a link go away just because the user is on the page it links to.
- Text should be of sufficient size and contrast to be easily readable.
    - At a minimum, you must support screen sizes equal to or less than max-width: 480pxResponsive Design:
    - Your design should be re-formatted to support these smaller screens. This could include changing font-size, margins, moving side bars, hiding elements, etc.

### II-E. Other Requirements

- Do not use an HTML/CSS template that you found on the Web or elsewhere! Build the HTML and CSS yourself "from scratch." Ignoring this requirement will result in a zero on the assignment and possible other academic integrity consequences.
- HTML tables used only for tabular data, not page layout.
    - Flexbox and/or CSS Grid may be used to help lay out your page, however, you may be able to handle the majority of layout through the use of the standard HTML Flow and box model.
- No plugin content (Flash, et al.)
- Site is fully accessible even without graphics enabled (e.g., use the alt attribute for all images).
- Images are not resized via code; all images must be at their native resolutions. If you need an image to be smaller, resize it in your graphic editor of choice.
    - We will be somewhat lenient about this due to High-Density Displays. There is no need, however, to have an image that is more than twice the dimensions that it's displayed at. If you do provide this size of image, then you should use one of the methods in Chapter 7 of Learning Web Design to specify the target device-pixel-ratio.
    - If you flagrantly use a gigantic image and use code (whether CSS or width & height attributes) to size it down to something small on your page, you will lose points in this category.
- Images must be saved in the appropriate Web-friendly format i.e. Photographs are usually saved as JPEGs, lineart graphics are saved as PNGs or GIFs. You may experiment with WebP images if you wish.

## III. Deliverables

### III-A. Your Github Content and Site Prototype

Your content must be written, chunked, and organized, and posted to your repo on GitHub as a markdown file named **235-project-1-content.md**. We will be checking this, and you need to **do your best work** as the content is weighted heavily on the rubric (see below)! Once this is done, begin building your HTML structure to fit the content (populating it with dummy content). Only when the structure is finalized should you be putting in the actual content!

Note: If you have never used Markdown before, it's extremely easy to work with. We will be doing a quick demo in class, and you might find this Markdown reference handy: [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

See myCourses dropbox for due date.

### III-B. Critique Session

We will have a critique session in class, right after the prototype is due. In small groups, you will both give and receive feedback on your projects, so be prepared for this discussion. While the critiques arenâ€™t going to directly determine your project grade, the feedback you receive may be taken into consideration, so make sure your project is built to impress!

### III-C. Final Submission

After receiving feedback from your classmates, make fixes and improvements to your site, and post it to Banjo before the due date. Also, ZIP your entire project 1 folder and upload it to this Assignment's File Submission.

Furthermore, Complete the Project 1 Assessment Survey.

# IV. Grading

The grading rubric for this project is visible in myCourses.  You should look it over carefully.  Find it by going to the "Assignments" section and clicking through to the "Project 1 Final Submission" dropbox.

Reminder - 'A' -level work means doing college-level work that goes beyond what we did in class. (You should be able to see this reflected in the online Rubric). Meeting only the base requirements will most likely only earn you a B. In order to get an A, you need to impress! Also make sure that this is 100% your work - no templates or frameworks are allowed.
