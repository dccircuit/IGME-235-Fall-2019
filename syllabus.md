# IGME-235, Introduction to Web Technology for Game Developers, Fall 2019: Syllabus

## Course Catalog Description

*This course introduces web technologies commonly used in the production and distribution of both content focused web sites, and in the creation of interactive applications and games. Students will create web sites and web-native interactive experiences, and publish them to the web. Programming projects are required.*

## Prerequisites
**IGME-110, Introduction to Interactive Media & IGME-106, Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving II**. We expect students in this class to have a basic working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and publishing to RIT's web hosting environment (people.rit.edu aka banjo). As this course involves a significant amount of coding, you should also feel confident in your programming skills.

**Important: This course is for GDD students only.  It replaces IGME-230, Web Site Design and Implementation.  If you previously took (and passed) IGME-230, then you shouldn’t be in this course.**

## Course Materials and Communication
There is a required textbook for this course.  It is *Learning Web Design, 5th Edition* by Jennifer Niederst Robbins.  In addition, there will be an assortment of online readings that you’ll receive over the course of the semester.  They will be uploaded to or linked to from our myCourses content area.

You may be assigned (or suggested) tutorials to complete from [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/), which you can access for free using your RIT login.

Most course materials and example code will be distributed via GitHub and myCourses, and you will also be learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage your own exercise and project files.

myCourses will be used for announcements, links to course content, quizzes and exams, assignment submissions, and grading.

A course-wide Discord server has been created to provide an avenue of communication between professors, teaching assistants, and students. There is a channel on it for your section as well as help channels for different topic areas.  You should use Discord as your primary way for getting in touch with your professor (unless instructed otherwise) and use email only for ‘official business’ where a more formal record is required.  The Discord server will be either deleted or wiped clean at the end of the semester, so be sure to ‘save’ any great piece of information you see on it elsewhere.

Lastly, as this is a course on using Web technologies, you will be expected to publish assignments online using RIT's public-facing Web environment.

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and will be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early unless specifically dismissed).

## Grading
Final course grades are determined using the following scale:

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |

### Projects (45%)
-	Project 1 (15%) - [Game Proposal Site](projects/project-1.md)
-	Project 2 (15%) - [Web Service Application](projects/project-2.md)
-	Project 3 (15%) - [Interactive Game or Experience](projects/project-3.md)

Note that while you should receive scores immediately for “Study Quizzes”, and within two weeks for Homework and Exams, the grading of Projects can sometimes take longer than two weeks.  If grading is taking longer than expected, I will announce progress in class and provide early estimated grades by email for those concerned about their score.  

### Exams (25%)
These exams consist of all manner of questions styles (multiple choice, true/false, matching, etc) as well as "write some code" questions. They will be 50 minutes long and administered via myCourses. There will be no make-ups or re-takes allowed without prior permission.
-	Midterm Exam (12.5%) - will be given during the 7th week of the semester.
-	Final Exam (12.5%) - will be given on the last official day of class for the semester.

### “Study Quizzes” (5%)
“Study Quizzes” are relatively easy, open-book, re-takeable quizzes, available well in advance on myCourses which you are required to complete online prior to the start of most classes.  They are intended to prepare you for the classroom experience where (after a quick review) you’ll focus more on a hands-on experience related to the material.

### Homework & other assignments (20%)
Homeworks, in-class exercises, checkpoints, and other assignments is essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of one “study quiz” and one other outside assignment per class meeting. Keep an eye on the myCourses Assignments section for the dues dates.

Assignments never submitted on myCourses, or submitted LATE without a valid excuse will receive a score of ZERO for that assignment. (procrastination is not a valid excuse). If you feel you have legitimate excuse, please contact the professor in **advance** of the due date either by email or during office hours.

**Important!** - When you submit web file(s) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to myCourses, they (or the folder they are contained in) must be zipped (not .tar, .rar, .gzip, .sit, etc) If you do not do so, myCourses will strip out all of the CSS and JavaScript, and leave you with a non-functioning and ugly web page. Unzipped assignments will therefore usually receive a grade of zero.

### Attendance & Participation (5%)
Note: Each absence is a loss of 1 of 5 points (and thus 1% off of your final grade). **Each additional absence beyond 5 is 5% off of final average**. Arriving late is 1/2 absence. Facebooking or similar off-task activity during lectures or demos will count as an absence for the day. If you have a legitimate reason for missing class, notify your professor in advance of the class meeting.

### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, solely for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed at the end of week 11, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty.

### Academic Dishonesty
The course policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an "F" as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.) Please review RIT's policy on academic dishonesty: http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html

## Important RIT Deadlines
-	Last day of add/drop is Tuesday, September 3, 2019.
-	Last day to withdraw with a grade of "W" is Friday, November 8, 2019.
-	You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade.

## Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", your professor should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class, via Discord, or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.
