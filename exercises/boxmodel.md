# Exercise: The Box Model

Let's work with the box model.  Also, prepare to say good-bye to Dig Dug.  This is the last in-class exercise where we will work with our friends, Fygar, Pooka, and Taizo Hori.

## Do the following:

1. You still have your color palette from the last exercise handy, right?  Good.

1. Let's get your main content displayed in a separate box.  First, make sure that you have everything important contained within a pair of `<main>` tags.

1. Apply a border to your `<main>` element so that you can see where it is on your page.  Something like **1px solid black** will do for now.

1. Now, center that block on your page by setting the margins to **0 auto**.  That's two values.  **0** for the top and bottom, and **auto** for the left and right.  Additionally, you have to set a width to the `<main>` element.  How about 4/5ths of the viewport width?  How many **vw**s would that be?

1. Is the content in your main area bumping up too close to the edges of it's container now that you can see the border?  Add some padding... maybe a **rem** or two.!

1. Do you have some other elements (like a `<header>` or `<footer>` maybe) that could also use the same treatment?  Just add the elements into the selector of your previous rule.  Maybe the selector will look like: **main, header, footer {margin: 0 auto; etc}**

1. Try to gather anything that's dangling outside of these main elements and move it inside because we're going to apply a background behind the main box.  Change the background color of your `<body>` tag one more time to something dark from your color palette... or maybe just some other dark color.  How does it look?
    - Apply your old background color to your primary content blocks.

1. Add padding and margins as necessary to make it so that backgrounds and borders added to things like your footer or your publishing information list are not too close to the content within the container, etc.

## If you get done early:
- Add a nice repeating background image behind the main content area.
- Basically clean things up as much as you can... In our next session we'll be asking you to zip up (and post to banjo) all that you (and your partner if you had one) got done and submit it for your HTML ICE Work "Assignment".  Keep in mind that you don't have to have it all done... We just want to see that you got some of the things we asked for in each exercise done.
