# Exercise: Colors

Let's adjust our colors (without killing our eyes). 

## Do the following:

1. Before you do anything rash, start by going here: http://coolors.co  
    - Use this tool to generate a color palette that might work well for your page.
    - Hints:
        - Start the Generator.
        - Try "Explore" and see if anything grabs you.  Note the "Picks" and "Best" sections for some vetted possibilitlies.
        - Try uploading an image from your page.  Back in "Generate" click the camera icon
        - If you like part of a palette, but not all of it, try "locking" the ones you like and hitting space to generate some other possibilities.
        - Click export and choose .png (or .svg?) to get an image file that you can easily reference and/or sample from in the future.
        - Keep in mind that you might be best off only using 2 or 3 of the colors in your palette along with a nice neutral white or off-white along with your other colors.
        
2. Pick one of your lightest, most neutral colors (or just use white if you don't have one that's suitable) and make it your new page background color.  Use the **background-color** property of the `<body>` element.
        
2. Apply one of your less strong (more muted whether light or dark) colors as a background color for some part of your page... Perhaps your footer or your publishing information list.  Use the **background-color** property.  
    - You may need to change the **color** of the text that appears within that area so that it's still legible.  Keep inheritance in mind... You don't need to apply the color to every element within the container, just apply it to the container.
    - Warning, pure white on a dark background is often too jarring.  Try a light gray instead.

3. Use one of your stronger (more vibrant) colors as a highlight color for your page.  Use it for your headings (or maybe the lines under your headings -- if you still have them).  Maybe add a border to your image(s) and apply it there.  Use the **color** property.

4. Finally, use one of your stronger colors as a new color for your text links.  Redefine the link colors in the proper order so that you don't have anything still in the default link color any more.
    - Hint: Lord Vader's Former Handle, Anakin.

## If you get done early:
- If you haven't already, move that style sheet to an external file and make sure it applies to your other "big picture" page as well.
