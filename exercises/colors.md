# Exercise: Colors

Let's adjust our colors (without killing our eyes). 

## Do the following:

1. Before you do anything rash, start by going here: http://coolors.co  
    - Use this tool to generate a color palette that might work well for your page.
    - Hints:
        - Start the Generator.
        - Try "Explore" and see if anything grabs you.  Note the "Picks" and "Best" sections for some vetted possibilitlies.
        - Try uploading an image from your page.  Back in "Generate" click the camera icon
        - If you like part of a palette, but not all of it, try "locking" the ones you like and hitting space to generate some other possibilities.
        - Click export and choose .png to get an image file that you can easily reference and/or sample from in the future.
        - Keep in mind that you might be best off only using 2 or 3 of the colors in your palette along with a nice neutral white or off-white along with your other colors.
