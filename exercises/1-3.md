# Exercise 1-3: Browse Past Projects 

On your own, begin to explore the sample projects below. Keep in mind that in many cases, Project 1 and Project 3 are rolled together into the same website.  If you find a project that is especially interesting or if you have questions about expectations for this semester, let us know.

## Do the following:
- Check out the links below and visit at least one project in each category.

### Project 1s
### Project 2s
### Project 3s (note, this used to be Project 4 in the past)
### Portfolios

## If you get done early:
- Start making some notes about project features, game ideas, portfolio elements that you might want to incorporate into your own project.
