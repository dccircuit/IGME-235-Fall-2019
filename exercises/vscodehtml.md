# Emmet/VS Code specific tips for HTML editing
- If VS Code is being too aggressive with autoclosing HTML tags as you try to mark-up existing text, go to File > Preference > Settings. Type `html` in the search box and one of the first settings will be "HTML: Auto Closing Tags".  Click to disable.
- If you want VS Code to wrap your selection in a tag, you can search for and install an Extension called "htmltagwrap" by Brad Gashler.  Then, just highlight the text you want to wrap and press `Alt + W`.  The tag you type next will automatically wrap your selection.  Press space and keep typing to add attributes.
