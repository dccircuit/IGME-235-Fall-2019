# Exercise: Validation 

Same as previous exercises:  Continue with partner if possible.  Figure out how to meet provided goals.  Ask people for help if needed.  Let us know if you run into an interesting validation error.

## Do the following:
1. Visit http://html5.validator.nu
2. Validate your "Dig Dug" page by URL, Upload, or Copy/Paste.
3. Correct any errors.

## If you get done early:
