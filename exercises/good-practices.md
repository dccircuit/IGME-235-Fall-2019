# Exercise: Good Web Practices Hunt 

This is a team exercise.  Create four person teams.  You will each stay at your own computer.  Only if all other teams are full can there be teams of 3 or fewer.  Once you are in a team that's large enough, the instructor will assign you one of the 4 categories below.  Follow the instructions for that category.

## Do the following (quickly. you have only about 5 to 10 minutes to locate a site and get ready to show it):
### If you are in a "Progressive Enhancement" team:
- Search the web for a site that exhibits Progressive Enhancement.
- At least two people should be looking at sites with JavaScript disabled, and two others within view should look at the same sites with Javascript enabled.
- Find a site that is still usable and provides baseline functionality with JavaScript off, but improves the experience with JavaScript on.
- When you, as a team, find a site that you agree you want to present, make sure that you have it loaded up (in two browsers one with JS off, one with JS on) of someone who has the Discord Desktop client installed so that you can screen-share your findings to the instructor.

### If you are in a "Responsive Design" team:
- Search the web for a site that exhibits Response Design.
- You should be able to test for responsive design simply by dragging your browser windows narrower and wider.
- Find a site that is shows the content being resized for good reasons... Not just a page that changes, but that re-organizes its content to make the mobile experience better.  Perhaps one that changes that way buttons or menus are display when you go mobile to make them easier to use.  Or a website that displays features that are more useful to mobile users than to desktop users.
- When you, as a team, find a site that you agree you want to present, make sure that you have it loaded up in the browser of someone who has the Discord Desktop client installed so that you can screen-share your findings to the instructor.

### If you are in a "Good Accessibility" team:
- Search the web for a site that exhibits Good Accessibility.
- Accessibility features make it easier for individuals with visual, mobility, auditory, and/or cognitive impairments to use a site.
- Find a site that has features that make it's usage easier for one or more of these groups.  Ideally two or more.  If you find a site that just helps one category of user, find the other team doing "Good Accessibility" and see what they're leaning toward... If it is the same category of user, RoShamBo to decide who gets to keep that user category and the loser has to pick a new user category to present on.
- When you, as a team, find a site that you agree you want to present, make sure that you have it loaded up in the browser of someone who has the Discord Desktop client installed so that you can screen-share your findings to the instructor.

### If you are in a "Excellent Performance" team:
- Search the web for a site that exhibits Excellent Performance (at least compared with another similar site)
- Look for a pair of sites with similar functionality where one site clearly performs better than the other.
- See if you can determine reasons for why there is this performance discrepancy between the sites.
- When you, as a team, find a pair of sites that you agree you want to present, make sure that you have them both loaded up in two side-by-side windows (on a single screen) on the computer of someone who has the Discord Desktop client installed so that you can screen-share your findings to the instructor.

## In 5 to 10 minutes, all team representatives should call the instructor who will answer and allow as many teams as possible to screen share their findings to the whole class.

## If you get done early:
- Look for a team that might be struggling to find an example of their own and give them a hand (if they want it).
 or
- Keep looking around... Maybe you'll discover something even better that you can share to the section-channel on Discord.

## After presentations are over:
- If your team did NOT get time to present their findings, post your findings to the class Discord channel for this section.
- If you found your own good example in one of these categories, add it to the class Discord channel with an explanation for why you picked it.
