# Exercise: Structural and Semantic HTML 

Same as previous exercises:  Continue with partner if possible.  Figure out how to meet provided goals.  Ask people for help if needed. 

## Do the following:

1. Continue with your previous (freshly valid!) in-class exercise.

    - Add `<hr>` between sections

    - Add appropriate additional `<h2>`, `<h3>`

    - Turn the Publishing Information into an Unordered List
    - Turn the Game Genre Information into a Description List (with name/value pairs).

    - Add a blockquote for the review excerpt.

1. Confirm that all of the above have worked (they all have a visible effect).

1. Add organizing/semantic tags:

    - Add a `<main>` section.
    - Add a `<header>` section.
    - Add a `<footer>` with information about where the content is from.

1. Add inline elements for additional formatting:
    - Italics (for emphasis), 
    - Bold (for strong meaning), 
    - Mark an acronym so that it's meaning appears on hover.  
    - Add a line break.

1. Adding a `<div/span>` with `class/id`?

    - Add the ID so that we can link to it in the next exercise... 
    - Add it to the "source" information at the very bottom of the page.

## If you get done early:
