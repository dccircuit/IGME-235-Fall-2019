# Exercise: Add Image & Styles 

Continue working with your partner if you had one or go it alone.  Remember that the steps provided are not exact.  Use your knowledge from the reading and review to proceed.  Ask your prof, the TA, your neighbor, etc for help.  Let us know if you discover something interesting, too.

## Do the following:
1. Download the image linked here: [Dig Dug Screen Shot](dig-dug-burnt.png)
2. Put it directly in the **game** folder that you created in Exercise 2-2.
3. Add it to your page by using an `<img>` element.
4. Preview.
5. Copy and paste the following `<style>` element into your page.  
```
<style>
    h1 { 
        color:red;
        font-family: sans-serif;
        border-bottom: 1px solid blue;
        }
    blockquote { 
        background-color: lightgray;
        padding: 1rem;
        }
</style>
```
6. Preview again.

## If you get done early:
- Add an additional image.
- Tweak the styles to use different colors, fonts, sizes.  (much more detail on this coming later)
  *or*
- Work further on your own homework by selecting a couple of appropriate images to go along with the game you selected.
