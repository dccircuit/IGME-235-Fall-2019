# Exercise: Site Design Process

This is a team exercise that will take part over two sessions.  Depending on your section this will either be broken between two classes or all in the same class.  Your instructor will explain how this affects your particular section.

## Overview

Your first job out of college is for an entrepreneur who’s made his fortune with his uncanny knack for buying the right domain names, then hiring a small clever creative team to build a killer web site for it. He has purchased what he believes will be one of the biggest killer domain names of his career and assigned it to you.  It’s now up to you to design a site for it.  To help you out, he has carefully selected teammates to assist you. (Your professor will inform you of your team). Needless to say, if you do this job well, your career is assured. Break into your teams and get started on this killer new site now!

The domain your boss has purchased will be shared when you are in your teams.

## As a Team, begin with the first 3 parts below

### Part 1: Define Purpose
1.	Why does this site exist?
    - (You'll need to brainstorm a purpose right away for this exercise)
    - ***Off limits: One topic is off limits, be sure you're aware of this.***
1.	What do you hope to achieve with it?
1.	What's the Goal?
	- Write it out.  We'll ask you for it.
	    - Decide before you move on.

### Part 2: Consider Audience
1.	Who will be using your site?
    - Who is your target demographic?
1.	What are some characteristics of these users?
1.	What technology will they have?
1.	How might that affect your design?
	- Make some notes.

### Part 3: Gather Ideas & Brainstorm
1. Brainstorm further about what features/sections/content your site could have
	- List numerous ideas without being critical
	- An off-the-wall idea may help bring an excellent 'reasonable' idea to mind
1. List features you came up with
	- Make a list.
1. Examine other sites.
	- what additional ideas did this bring to mind?
1. Ask potential users (if you can find some).
    - ***If your class spans across two days, come back with your list of ideas.***

## On the second day (or second half of session), you'll only have a very short amount of time (10 minutes) to do the following:
 
### Part 4: Organize Ideas
1. Take ideas and consider them
    - Do they help the goals of the site defined at the beginning?
    - Seek maximum impact with minimum resource consumption
1. Sort ideas into categories
    - Select the ideas that supported the goal most clearly and group them into categories.
 
### Part 5: Determine Navigation
1. How should this be organized?
	- By category?
	- By date?
	- By alphabetical order?
	- Others?
1. Draw a conceptual diagram.
 
### Part 6: Sketch Pages
- Use Blank Paper and Design Tools provided by your professor!

### Part 7: Present Design to the Class
- Professor will provide details of expectations.
