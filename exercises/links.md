# Exercise: Links 

Even though, you're moving on to your 235 Home Page assignment for Homework, let's spend a little more time with the Dig Dug page.

## Do the following:

1. Create the following file structure and put your index.html page in the top folder.  Put the image into the appropriate subfolder and preview.

make picture of 'game' folder with 'images' folder inside.

1. Fix the link to the image so that it works.

1. Create a simple page that contains only a large image of the game (call the file pic1.html).  (ok if huge for now, but include alt text).  

1. Put it in a subfolder (maybe called "big").
(make sure the large image is still in the images folder).

1. Link from the index.html to the image page.

1. Link from the image page to the index.html.

1. Add an additional link to the source info only on the index page by adding a fragment name to the URL of the index page. 

1. Make an external link to the page on MobyGames

1. Change that link so that it creates a new window when clicked.

## If you get done early:

- Add a "thumbnail" of the screen shot to the index.html so that when it's clicked on, it goes to the big-view page.
- Add additional big images that represent the game.
