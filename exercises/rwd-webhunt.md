# Exercise: Responsive Web Design Webhunt

Your mission:  Locate a website that showcases Responsive Web Design.

## Do the following, individually:

Search on the web for a website that features responsive mobile web design.  

Some ideas of the kinds of sites to look for:
- Clothing brands
- Restaurant chains
- Banking websites
- News outlets

Get those browsers out of "maximized" mode and start adjusting browser widths!

In particular look for these features:
- A fluid layout
- Multiple breakpoints
- A layout where sections drop or shift to new locations when narrower.
- Typography that becomes more legible, smaller, with tighter line heights, and/or with narrower margins on narrow screens.
- A navigation style that changes at a narrow breakpoint.

The more of these features the better and then **call the professor** on Desktop Discord (not the browser version) to share your findings with the rest of the class.  We will look at your findings until we have no more time.

## After presentations are over:
- Post your RWD example site to the newly available Discord channel "responsive-web-design" which was just made available to you.
- This is worth half an attendance/participation point, so be sure to post, even if later on today.
