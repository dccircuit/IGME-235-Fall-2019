# Exercise: Formatting Text

Let's modify our text a bit. 

## Do the following:

1. Apply a main font (I suggest **Arial**) and a common font (I suggest **sans-serif**) to your whole page.  What element should you apply it to?  Leave it the default size.
    - Hint:  Use the **font-family** property and two comma-separated values.

1. Add a Web Font to your page from *Google Fonts*.  Apply it to your **headings**.
    - Helpful steps:
        - Go to http://fonts.google.com
        - Pick something interesting (click the plus by it)
        - Click the bottom drawer.
        - Copy and Paste the standard link into your `<head>`
        - Copy the **font-family** declaration into your heading style rule(s)

1. Try adding a universal selector to your style rules and adding a "1px solid gray" **border** to everything.  See what it looks like, but don't leave it there.
    - Hint, the universal selector is a single character.

## If you get done early:
- Try proving that you can make a functional **decendant** selector where a paragraph (or other element) that's located in your `<footer>` (for example) has a different style applied to it than a paragraph that appears elsewhere on your page.
