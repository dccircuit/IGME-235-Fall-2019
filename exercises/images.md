# Exercise: Adding Images 

We've got some bitmap images for you to add to your Dig Dug page.  

## Do the following:

1. Here's an image that we want you to add to your page. ([fygar_inflate.jpg](fygar_inflate.jpg)) However, it's too large to fit properly on the page, and we'd like it to be a small decorative image rather than a large piece of main content.
    - Use an image editing tool to crop some of the extra black border off.
    - Reduce the dimensions of the image so that it can be added to the page without the need to change the height and width through code.
    - Consider whether or not a GIF or 8-bit PNG would reduce the file size further.  Test your theory.  (Note that the "Export As" command in Photoshop makes it pretty simple to compare file sizes between formats)
    
1. Add the edited image to your page (save it into your images folder and link to it with a relative path).

1. Add this Dig Dug logo image as well ([dig-dug.png](dig-dug.png)), but for this one, add it at it's full file size, changing it's display dimensions using only code.  Put this logo at the very top, right above or below your existing `<h1>` for now.
    - You may change it's size using height and width attributes for the moment... Later, you'll do this through CSS.

1. add the following inline style to your opening body tag (as a quick test):  `style="background-color:lightblue;"`  Notice that the area around your new Dig Dug logo is transparent and you can see the background through it.  What if the logo had been a .jpg?

## If you get done early:

- Validate your new additions. -- It may not like some things that we've told you to do, that's okay, just take note of what the validator says.
- Select a better background color to apply.  Just Google for an HTML Color Picker (Google will actually display a simple one for you at the top of the search result page).  You can replace the word `lightblue` with another color such as `#ffe8a8` (that's a hexadecimal color code).
